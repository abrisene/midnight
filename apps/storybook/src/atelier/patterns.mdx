# Patterns

These are various SVG patterns that can be used as backgrounds or decorative elements in your UI.

## Dot Grid Pattern

<Canvas of={PatternStories.DotGrid} />

## Grid Pattern

<Canvas of={PatternStories.Grid} />

## Hexagon Pattern

<Canvas of={PatternStories.Hexagon} />

## Diagonal Stripes Pattern

<Canvas of={PatternStories.DiagonalStripes} />

## Usage

To use these patterns in your components, import them from `@acausal/ui-core/patterns` and use them as React components. You can customize their appearance by passing props such as `width`, `height`, `fill`, `stroke`, etc.

Example:

```jsx
import { DotGridPattern } from "@acausal/ui-core/patterns";

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <DotGridPattern width={200} height={200} fill="#000" radius={2} gap={20} />
  );
}
```

Each pattern component is built on top of a base `BasePattern` component, which allows for consistent sizing and styling across all patterns.
